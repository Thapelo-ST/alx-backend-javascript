# ES6 data manipulation

Data manipulation, all about setting and mapping data on the console and all is done in arrays.

## Arrays

- `push()` - adds one or more elements to an array.
- `set()` - instances inserts a new element with a specified value in to this set, if there isn't an element with the same value already in this set
